A neural network based Legend of the 5 Rings L\+CG AI written in C++

This AI is inspired by Alpha\+Go Zero. It combines Monte Carlo tree search with deep neural network reinforcement learning. It uses only self play to improve itself.

\subsection*{Initial thoughts}

The state/action space for L5R is very large especially considering the entire card pool. Also hidden information/randomness is still a challenge to take into consideration.

As a simple initial proof of concept the initial version will play with the following limitations.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item no hidden information (hand exposed, and no deck shuffling)
\item turn based bidding starting with first player
\item lion and crane starter decks only
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Motivations}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I am an L5R player myself looking to better my own gameplay and deckbuilding
\item I have an interest in programming and machine learning
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Long term Goals}

Once the initial engine is complete and can successfully learn to play with these limitations I would like to start to experiment and evolve it with more features.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Hidden information
\item Supporting different clan matchups
\item Deckbuilding and deck strength evalutation
\item Increase to support card pool and evolve with the meta
\item Add a G\+UI to the engine for easy human play 
\end{DoxyItemize}
